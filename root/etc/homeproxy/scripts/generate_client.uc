 *
 * The actual client generator is generator/client.uc; this script is the
 * thin entry point that init.d/homeproxy execve's. Responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. Load UCI into the HomeProxyConfig domain model.
 *   2. Resolve the GenerationContext env: the WAN resolver (ubus) and the two
 *      domain-resource lists (fs). This is the process-level boundary, which
 *      is why it lives here and not under generator/.
 *   3. Call generate(dm, env) to get the sing-box JSON object.
 *   4. Write atomically: candidate tmp -> `sing-box check` -> mv to live.
 *
 * The check is here (and not in the runtime, and not in the generator)
 * because the architecture guide mandates the generator produce
 * "atomic write candidate + serialization" and the runtime is already
 * structured around "a failing generation leaves the previous file in
 * place" (see runtime/config.sh's hp_ensure_live). Having the shell do
 * the check keeps that contract single-sourced.

		 * names; the UI only offers extra_tags on remote rule-sets, so this
