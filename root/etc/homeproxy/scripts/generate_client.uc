 *     scripts/generate_client.uc: process-level entry point.
 *
 * The actual client generator is generator/client.uc; this script is the
 * thin entry point that init.d/homeproxy execve's. Responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. Load UCI into the HomeProxyConfig domain model.
 *   2. Resolve the GenerationContext env: the WAN resolver (ubus) and the two
 *      domain-resource lists (fs). This is the process-level boundary, which
 *      is why it lives here and not under generator/.
 *   3. Call generate(dm, env) to get the sing-box JSON object.
 *   4. Write atomically: candidate tmp -> `sing-box check` -> mv to live.
 *
 * The check is here (and not in the runtime, and not in the generator)
 * because the architecture guide mandates the generator produce
 * "atomic write candidate + serialization" and the runtime is already
 * structured around "a failing generation leaves the previous file in
 * place" (see runtime/config.sh's hp_ensure_live). Having the shell do
 * the check keeps that contract single-sourced.

		 * written by hp_prepare_runtime_files from the list the resource
		 * updater maintains - is the only thing that lets the route and DNS
		 * halves recognise a mainland IPv6 destination.  When it is absent
		 * (the list is missing, or had no usable prefix when the file was
		 * last written) both halves have to stay silent about IPv6 instead
		 * of naming a rule-set that is not there: a `rule_set:` pointing at
		 * a missing file makes sing-box reject the entire config, which the
		 * health gate turns into a rollback and an unproxied network.  The

		 * warning in the ruleset and the log.

		 * is therefore the worst possible choice here - it reports every
		 * file as missing, so this flag would be permanently false and the
		 * whole IPv6 split would stay switched off with nothing logged. The
		 * one-argument call sites elsewhere in the tree (homeproxy.uc's
		 * cleanup_exec_dir) are correct and must stay as they are.

		 * `path` names a file that is not there is a filesystem question, and
		 * asking it from the generator would break the "generator/ is a pure
		 * function of its arguments" invariant guard 27 enforces.
		 *
		 * Only enabled local rule-sets are looked at, mirroring the filter
		 * build_user_rulesets() applies first - a disabled entry never reaches
		 * the generated configuration, so a missing file behind one is not an
		 * error.  The status is three-way on purpose:
		 *
		 *   missing key    the file is not there, or not a regular file, or
		 *                  empty - all three make `sing-box check` fail, the
		 *                  first two with a filesystem error and the third
		 *                  with "invalid sing-box rule-set file"

		 *                  "checked and absent"
		 *
		 * A `{tag}` placeholder in a path is expanded to one file per tag
		 * before the stat, because that is what sing-box does with it: a
		 * multi-tag rule-set whose second tag has no file fails the same way
		 * the first one would.  rule_set_tags() is imported from
		 * generator/common.uc so this and the generator agree on the tag
		 * names; the UI only offers extra_tags on remote rule-sets, so this
		 * path is reachable through a direct UCI write rather than the form.
		 *
		 * This is root's view of the filesystem, which is what the generator
		 * needs; whether the jailed sing-box user can read the file is the
		 * runtime's business (hp_prepare_runtime_files hands the archive over
